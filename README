Parallella Case
===============

The Parallella board from Adapteva is pretty amazing, but it tends
to run rather hot.  This is a case that lets you put a fan over the
Zync SoC.  In the case, mine runs at ~110 degF (45ish Real Degrees).

The design isn't perfect, but it's nicely decorative, at least for me.

The moire.scad file is interesting/amusing, and can be used to make
decorative grills easily.
